# Project Description

The Pet Store Application is an engaging web-based platform that brings the joy of exploring pet stores and interacting with adorable pets to users. This application provides a seamless experience for users to discover various pet stores, view available pets, leave reviews, and manage their account activities.


## Project Structure

- **Frontend:**
  - The `src` folder contains React components, context providers, and CSS styles.
  - Routing is managed using React Router.
  - User authentication is handled using JWT tokens.

- **Backend:**
  - The Flask application is structured with routes, models, and middleware.
  - SQLAlchemy is used for database models, and Flask JWT Extended manages authentication.
